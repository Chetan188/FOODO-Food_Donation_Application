# FOODO-Food_Donation_Application


Food Donation Application created using React JS for frontend and Python Django Rest Framework API for backend

This application will create a common collaboration between a donor/user and a volunteer from the NGO, where the donor uploads all the food details which includes food type, date/time of food cooked, location of the donor where there is the availability of food, and donor details. 
The NGO Volunteer can check if there are any donations available and can accept the donations. 
The food item then shall be collected by a volunteer who is connected to the donor via the application. 
The system allocates the food donations based on the priority as one or more volunteers would want to accept the donations.
